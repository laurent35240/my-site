Hi, I am Laurent. 
I am a French tech manager with more than 10 years experience in web and cloud development.
I specialized in PHP, eCommerce and IoT.

You can also check my [Manager README](https://managerreadme.com/readme/laurent35240/i0rvpm) to know more about my managing style. 

I am currently living in Toulouse and working as Director of Engineering for [Westwing](https://www.westwing.de/).

I am still a geek who likes to play retro games and lego with his children.
