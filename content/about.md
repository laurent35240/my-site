Hi, I am Laurent. 
I am a french developer with more than 10 years experience in web development.
I specialized in PHP, eCommerce and IoT.

I am currently living in Warsaw and working as Tech Lead / Senior Software Engineer for [Westwing](https://www.westwing.de/).

I am still a geek who likes to play retro games and lego with his children.
